            <h3>Franchise Opportunities</h3>
            <p>
                A franchisee is an independent small business owner who operates a third-party retail outlet called a franchise. In doing so, the franchisee has purchased the right to use an existing business's trademarks, associated brands, and other proprietary knowledge to market and sell the same brand, and uphold the same standards as the first business.Franchises are an extremely common way of doing business. In fact, it is hard to drive more than a few blocks in most cities without seeing a franchise business. Examples of well-known franchise business models include McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), Subway, United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS), and H&R Block (NYSE: HRB). In the United States, there are franchise business opportunities available across a wide variety of industries.

                When a business wants to garner more market share or increase its geographical presence at a low cost, one solution could be to create a franchise for its product and brand name. The franchisor is the original or existing business that sells the right to use its name and idea. The franchisee is the individual who buys into the original company by purchasing the right to sell the franchisorâ€™s goods or services under the existing business model and trademark.
                
                The relationship between a franchisee and franchisor is inherently one of advisee and advisor. The franchisor provides continual guidance and support concerning general business strategies such as hiring and training staff, setting up shop, advertising its products or services, sourcing its supply, and so on.
                
                To start, the franchisor assigns the franchisee an exclusive location where no other franchises within the same underlying business currently operate in order to prevent competition and help ensure success. In return for the franchisor's advisory role, use of intellectual property, and experience the franchisee generally pays a startup fee plus an ongoing percentage of gross revenues to the franchisor.
